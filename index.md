excerpt: "About Me..."
---
I am a Research and Information Literacy Services Librarian at the State University of New York at Fredonia. 
After completing my B.A. at the University of Pennsylvania in 2016, I was a Digital Resource Specialist at the Free Library of Philadelphia. I was also a Reading Room Supervisor at the Kislak Center for Special Collections, Rare Books and Manuscripts of the University of Pennsylvania.
During graduate school I helped co-found a student chapter of the American Library Association, where I served as co-President. I also had a Research and Instruction Librarian internship at Binghamton University during the summer break. I graduated from the School of Information Studies at McGill University in 2019 with my Master of Information Studies (MISt). After graduating, I was a Reference Librarian at Genesee Community College and a Research and Instruction Librarian at D'Youville College.
